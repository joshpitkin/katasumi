================================================================================
Date: 2026-01-27
Task: PHASE1-SEARCH-002 - AI-powered semantic search
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

Implemented AI-powered semantic search engine with support for multiple providers:

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
1. AISearchEngine class with support for 4 AI providers:
   - OpenAI (gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo)
   - Anthropic (claude-3-sonnet, claude-3-opus)
   - OpenRouter (unified API for multiple models)
   - Ollama (local LLM, no API key required)

2. Core functionality:
   - semanticSearch(): Natural language query understanding with AI re-ranking
   - explainShortcut(): Plain English explanations of shortcuts
   - Automatic fallback to keyword search on AI failures
   - 5-second timeout (configurable) for AI requests
   - Graceful error handling for network issues and invalid API keys

3. Provider-specific features:
   - OpenAI: Bearer token authentication
   - Anthropic: x-api-key header with anthropic-version
   - OpenRouter: Support for model selection (openai/gpt-4, anthropic/claude-3-sonnet, etc.)
   - Ollama: No authentication required, configurable baseUrl

4. Comprehensive test coverage:
   - 19 test cases covering all providers
   - Timeout handling tests
   - Fallback mechanism tests
   - Error handling for missing API keys
   - Filter support (platform, app, category, context)
   - 100% test pass rate

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
- Created: /workspace/packages/core/src/ai-search-engine.ts (400+ lines)
- Created: /workspace/packages/core/src/__tests__/ai-search-engine.test.ts (550+ lines)
- Modified: /workspace/packages/core/src/index.ts (added export)

VERIFICATION:
 All 80 tests pass (including 19 new AI search tests)
 TypeScript compilation successful
 Builds without errors
 Exported from @katasumi/core package

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET:
 AISearchEngine class accepts AIProviderConfig and DatabaseAdapter
 Supports OpenAI (gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo) with API key
 Supports Anthropic (claude-3-sonnet, claude-3-opus) with API key
 Supports OpenRouter (unified API for multiple models) with API key
 Supports Ollama (local, no API key required) with baseUrl
 OpenRouter allows model selection from multiple providers
 semanticSearch() extracts intent from natural language query
 Results are re-ranked by AI-determined relevance
 Falls back to keyword search if AI provider fails
 AI requests timeout after 5 seconds (configurable)
 explainShortcut() returns plain English description

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- AI responses are parsed from JSON format
- Keyword search provides initial candidate set (top 50)
- AI re-ranks candidates based on semantic understanding
- All API calls use fetch() with AbortController for timeouts
- TypeScript types ensure type safety across all providers
- Mock fetch used in tests to avoid real API calls


## 2026-01-27 - PHASE1-SEARCH-003: searchByKeys Implementation

### Task: Implement reverse lookup - search by key combination

**What was implemented:**
- Added `searchByKeys()` method to KeywordSearchEngine class
- Accepts key string and optional platform parameter
- Normalizes key variants: Cmd/⌘/Command, Ctrl/Control, Alt/Option, etc.
- Handles Unicode symbols: ⌘, ⌥, ⇧, ⌃, ⏎, ⌫, ⎋, ␣, ⇥
- Normalizes separators: converts spaces, dashes, underscores to '+'
- Case-insensitive matching
- Supports multi-platform search (when platform not specified)
- Returns shortcuts matching the key combination
- Added comprehensive test suite (15 test cases)

**Key features:**
1. **Key normalization**: Converts various key representations to a standard format
   - Example: "Cmd+K", "⌘K", "Command+K", "cmd-k" all normalize to "cmd+k"
2. **Platform filtering**: Can search specific platform or all platforms
3. **Duplicate prevention**: When searching all platforms, each shortcut appears only once
4. **Empty string handling**: Returns empty array for empty or whitespace-only input
5. **Complex combinations**: Handles multi-modifier keys like "Ctrl+B %"

**Tests verified:**
- Exact key matches on specific platforms (mac, windows, linux)
- Unicode symbol normalization (⌘K → Cmd+K)
- Long-form normalization (Command+K → Cmd+K, Control+C → Ctrl+C)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Simple and single character keys (vim shortcuts)
- Cross-platform search
- Complex key combinations with multiple modifiers
- Different separator types (space, dash, underscore, plus)
- Edge cases (empty string, nonexistent keys)
- No duplicate shortcuts in multi-platform results

**Files modified:**
- `/workspace/packages/core/src/keyword-search-engine.ts` - Added searchByKeys method and normalizeKeys helper
- `/workspace/packages/core/src/__tests__/keyword-search-engine.test.ts` - Added 15 comprehensive tests

**Test results:**
- All 33 keyword search engine tests pass (including 15 new searchByKeys tests)
- All 95 core package tests pass
- Build successful with no TypeScript errors
